# 🔁 Looping in C Programming

## 📘 Overview
This repository contains C programs that demonstrate **looping statements** — essential constructs used to execute a block of code multiple times until a specific condition is met.

Looping allows programmers to **automate repetitive tasks**, making programs more efficient and concise.

## 🧠 Topics Covered
The following looping structures are demonstrated in this repository:
- `for` loop  
- `while` loop  
- `do...while` loop  
- Nested loops  
- Use of `break` and `continue` statements  

## 🎯 Objective
The goal of this repository is to help learners:
- Understand different types of loops in C programming.  
- Learn how iteration works using conditions and counters.  
- Explore real-life examples of loops (e.g., multiplication tables, factorials, number patterns).
